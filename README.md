# PyRust Image Processor

A high-performance image processing application that demonstrates Python-Rust integration, combining the ease of Python's GUI capabilities with Rust's processing speed.

## Features

- üöÄ High-performance image processing powered by Rust
- üñºÔ∏è User-friendly Python GUI built with PySide6
- üîÑ Seamless Python-Rust integration via PyO3
- üì¶ Batch processing capabilities

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Rust (latest stable version)
- Cargo (comes with Rust)
- A C compiler (for Windows: MSVC, for Unix: gcc)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alieyns/pyrust-image-processor.git
   cd pyrust-image-processor
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   # On Windows
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   # On Unix or MacOS
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the package:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

## Usage

- Add simple filters to an image.
- Batch process images.
- Save the processed images.
- Study the code to learn how to integrate Rust and Python.
- Build a simple GUI using PySide6.
- Benchmark the performance of the image processing.

## Development

To set up the development environment:

1. Install development dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```

2. Install pre-commit hooks:
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```
